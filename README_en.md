	These are some simple c program during learn c language in college.
	Every file is a c program.
	Use Gcc to compile it.

	Following is Naming rules in this repository:( I'll change it future may be.)
		file name        low_low.extension     hello_world.c
		variable name    lower camel case      tableNumber
		function name    lower camel case      addSomeNumber()
		global constants uppercase letter	   MAXNUMBER
		global variable  k+lower camel case    kcountNum
